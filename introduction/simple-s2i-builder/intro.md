THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

If this is the first time you are reading about Source-to-Image (S2I) it is strongly suggested to start with one of the other introductory tutorials which show how to deploy an application from source code using an existing S2I builder image. 
Here is one of those tutorials: https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/deploying-python/

However, the goal of this tutorial is to show, step by step, how to create a simplified S2I builder image yourself and then use the same image to create a new image containing your simplified application. 

This tutorial is divided into two main parts.

1. Part One explains what's needed to create an S2I builder image.
1. Part two explains how to build our simplified application using the S2I builder image to create a new image.
