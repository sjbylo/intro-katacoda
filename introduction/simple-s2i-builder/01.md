The Source-To-Image (S2I) tool comes fully integrated with OpenShift.  It is especially interesting for OpenShift developers as it can shield developers from the details of creating Docker container images.  More can be read about S2I at the [project's home page](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/) and there are several [blogs](https://blog.openshift.com/deploying-applications-from-images-in-openshift-part-one-web-console/) about the subject. 

Two of the main reasons to use S2I are:

1. A developer can get up and running with Docker without knowing anything about Docker itself.  This is great for Developers who are not interested in Docker and just want to get their code running on OpenShift. 
1. An Enterprise wants to have more control over how their teams build container images and don't want to allow developers the freedom to install anything they choose (as root) into container images.  The S2I process limits the user somewhat from the system and does not allow anything to be installed during the S2I process using root privileges. 

So, for this scenario, imagine you are a Lead Developer or an Operations Lead and want to create a way for your developers to easily and securly create docker images containing their applications. 

# The simplified runtime

The simplified application "runtime" will be represented by the Linux "cat" command which can display the contents of files.
The S2I Builder Image will contain the command "cat" and will know where to place the source code provided by the developer to that it can be "executed". 

During the S2I build process, source code will be copied into the container, the assemble script will know where to place the source code and the run script will know how to execute the application.

The resulting application image will simply display the contents of any "source code" files provided by the developer during the S2I build process. 

(The "simplified runtime" used in this tutorial is just the Linux command "cat", which will output the "source code" provided by running the command "cat src/*")

The process looks like this:
