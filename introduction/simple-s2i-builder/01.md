If this is the first time you read about S2I it is suggested to go to one of the other tutorials which can help you learn how to deploy an application from source code using a Source-to-Image builder image. 
Here is one of them: https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/deploying-python/

The goal of this tutorial is to show, step by step, how to create a simplified S2I builder image and then use the image to create a simple application. 

This tutorial is divided into three parts.

Part One explains what's needed to create a new builder image.

- The "simplified runtime" is just the command "cat", which will output the "source code" provided by running the command "cat tmp/*"

Part two explains the "source code" for the simplified application. 

- The "source code" is simply files under a src/ directory in your workspace.
