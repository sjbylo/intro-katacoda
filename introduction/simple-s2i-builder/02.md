An S2I Builder Image can be created from any standard Docker image. 
The Dockerfile in the _builder/_ directory creates an S2I Builder image from a base centos image. 

The diagram shows one way an S2I Builder Image can be created.

![S2I Builder Image Build Process](../../assets/introduction/simple-s2i-builder/s2i-builder-image-build-process.png)

Try the following:

Look at the Dockerfile to understand how it creates a special S2I Builder Image, essentially by:

1. adding the needed S2I scripts (mainly _assemble_ and _run_) and 
2. labelling the image appropriately.

``clear; cat builder/Dockerfile``{{execute}}

# Structure of an S2I Builder Image. 

+ _assemble_ script - this script is executed during the S2I build process and knows how to 'build' the applicaiton from source code. 
+ _run_ script - this script is executed to launch the application. 
+ _usage_ - displays the Builder Image usage information.

# Create S2I Builder Image using Docker

Create the S2I Builder Image using the usual Docker build command (using the Dockerfile inside the _builder/_ directory): 

``docker build -t s2i-simple-builder builder``{{execute}}

Notice how the S2I script files are copied into the image:

``Step 3 : COPY ./s2i/ /usr/libexec/s2i``

The location is defined by the label:

``io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url="image:///usr/libexec/s2i"``

and, so that OpenShift knows this is an S2I Builder Image, label it such:

``io.openshift.tags="builder"``

Then try to execute the Builder Image like this:

``docker run s2i-simple-builder``{{execute}}

Notice that when "docker run" is executed against the S2I Builder Image directly (i.e.  without providing any "source code") a message is displayed describing how to use the image.  The content of the "usage" file is shown and the container terminates. 

The above "docker build" command creates the image but only stores it into the local docker storage and not into a docker registry. We'll do the exact same docker build again but this time inside Openshift and have the new image pushed into the internal registry.

# Create S2I Builder Image using OpenSHift

Run the below commands:

Create the Build Configuration which will build our S2I Builder Image (using the Docker build strategry).  ``--binary=true`` simply means we will upload the Dockerfile and the S2I scripts from a local directory. 

``oc new-build --name s2i-simple-builder --binary=true``{{execute}}

Start the build using the content of the local _builder/_ directory, following the progress and waiting for completion.

``oc start-build s2i-simple-builder --from-dir=builder --follow --wait``{{execute}}

If all went well, the new S2I buider image (s2i-simple-builder) has been created and pushed successfully into the registry.  You should see a "Push successful" message. 

# Examin the Builder Image Stream

Now, have a look at the newly created Image Stream which references and tracks the S2I Builder Image in the registry.  

``oc get is``{{execute}}

``oc describe is s2i-simple-builder``{{execute}}

Should the Builder Image be updated, fresh application image builds can be automatically triggered through this Image Stream. 

Switch your role now to that of a developer. The S2I Builder Image can now be used to create a runtime image containing your application.  Continue to the next step to build and run your own simplified application.
